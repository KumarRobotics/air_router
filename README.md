# AirRouter

To use this node, you should create a QGC mission with the following
characteristics:

1. We take the take off waypoint as the origin (command 22). Please be sure to
   align this takeoff point with your image origin.

2. Be sure to create **only one** fence (inclusion fence), and be sure that all the waypoints are
   within the fence.

3. You can create as many *no fly* zones as you want (exclusion fences).
